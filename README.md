# odin-recipes

Introductory "Recipes" project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course, working with basic HTML and getting acclimated to Git, Github, and the Command Line. Project started 5-25-2023

Note the lack of fancy styling, per the scope of the project. (Also, you may have noticed the recipes get progressively less impressively detailed.) My intention with the "Recipes" project is to learn more about Git, Github, and working with the Command Line. I was already familiar with HTML from prior experience.
