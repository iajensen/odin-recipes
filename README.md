# odin-recipes

Introductory "Recipes" project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course, working with basic HTML and getting acclimated to Git, Github, and the Command Line. Project started 5-25-2023

Note the lack of fancy styling, per the scope of the project. My intention with the "Recipes" project is to learn more about Git, Github, and working with the Command Line. I was already familiar with HTML and CSS from prior experience.
