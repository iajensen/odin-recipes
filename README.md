# odin-recipes

Introductory "Recipes" project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course, working with basic HTML (which I'd worked with quite a bit before) and getting acclimated to Git, Github, and the Command Line (which were all quite new to me. Learning experience!). Project started 5-25-2023
